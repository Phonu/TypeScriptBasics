/**
 * I have around 7 yrs of experience in Mobile App Development, started with iOS then moved
 *  to react native. Last 4 yrs, i am working on react native projects.
 *  1st Project - InfyMe - it was a company portal App used by the employee of infosys where
 * the employee check the their and update the info, check the project allocaton, apply for leaves
 * and many other features which are part of company portal App.
 * 
 * 2nd Project - Sydney Health App - its was Health Domain App, where the user can check the status
 * of claims, get the appointment from doctors, get the list of nearby chemist and get the rewards points
 * of completion of particular task provided.
 * 
 * 3rd Project - Health Tracker project which was seperate SDK project of Sydney health, where the user can
 * can calculate the calories burns wrt the activity compeltion like dancing, cycling and many other activities.
 * User can check calories burns, count of number of steps, sleep hrs.
 * 
 * And last project, we are create the similiar packages like the npm but making them comfortable with
 * OTT platform (on OTT OS image). We use to fork the npm packages and then make it compitable and 
 * we were using React Native new Architecture here, i.e., TurboModules and fabric. We need to JS interfaces 
 * for apis which will be invoked from JS layer and then implementation of the apis were written on
 * native layer means on C++ layer.
 * 
 * 
 * After creating the compitable packages, we need to create the Demo App which will be shared to the customer 
 * so they can get the steps/guide, how to use the packages.
