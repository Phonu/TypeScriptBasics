You can use GitHub Actions to automate builds, tests, and deployments for React Native apps.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Create Workflow File

Inside your React Native repo, create:

.github/workflows/ci.yml

ðŸ”¹ 2. Example CI/CD Workflow

Hereâ€™s a sample workflow that runs on push & pull requests:

name: React Native CI/CD

on:
push:
branches: [ main ]
pull_request:
branches: [ main ]

jobs:
build:
runs-on: macos-latest # required for iOS builds
strategy:
matrix:
platform: [ios, android]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Cache Gradle (Android only)
        if: matrix.platform == 'android'
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.gradle/caches
            ~/.gradle/wrapper
          key: gradle-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
          restore-keys: gradle-${{ runner.os }}-

      - name: Build Android
        if: matrix.platform == 'android'
        run: |
          cd android
          ./gradlew assembleDebug

      - name: Build iOS
        if: matrix.platform == 'ios'
        run: |
          cd ios
          pod install --repo-update
          xcodebuild -workspace MyApp.xcworkspace \
                     -scheme MyApp \
                     -sdk iphonesimulator \
                     -configuration Debug \
                     build

      - name: Run Tests
        run: yarn test

ðŸ”¹ 3. Key Steps Explained

Checkout Code â†’ Pulls repo.

Setup Node â†’ Ensures correct Node version.

Install Dependencies â†’ Installs JS deps via yarn or npm.

Cache Gradle â†’ Speeds up Android builds.

Build Android â†’ Uses Gradle.

Build iOS â†’ Uses Xcode + CocoaPods.

Run Tests â†’ Runs Jest tests.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Adding CD (Deployment)

Android â†’ Generate .aab (release) and upload to Play Store with Fastlane
.

iOS â†’ Archive with Xcode and deploy to TestFlight via Fastlane.

Example Android release step:

- name: Build Android Release
  run: |
  cd android
  ./gradlew bundleRelease

- name: Upload to Play Store
  uses: r0adkll/upload-google-play@v1
  with:
  serviceAccountJson: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}
  packageName: com.myapp
  releaseFile: android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

ðŸ”¹ 5. Secrets Needed

Add these in GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets & variables â†’ Actions:

GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT â†’ JSON key for Play Store upload.

APPLE_DEVELOPER_KEY â†’ For TestFlight deploys.

Signing keys (keystore for Android, certificates for iOS).

âœ… Now you have:

CI â†’ Run tests & build on every PR/commit.

CD â†’ Auto-deploy to TestFlight / Play Store.
